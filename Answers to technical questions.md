## Technical questions

>How long did you spend on the coding test? What would you add to your solution if you had more time? If you didn't spend much time on the coding test then use this as an opportunity to explain what you would add.

I spent way more than 3 hours. I think, I spent even more than 12 hours. Partially this is connected with the fact that I playing around with Nx and Nest (both technologies are quite new for me). It is still a lot of things to improve in the project: more tests, moving components to the entities library, adding proper storybook stories, splitting large libraries into library-per-component etc.

>What was the most useful feature that was added to the latest version of your chosen language? Please include a snippet of code that shows how you've used it.

I guess, I need to check TS documentation, because I don't remember latest features of the TypeScript. 

>How would you track down a performance issue in production? Have you ever had to do this?

Environment based performance issues are pretty rare for the frontend, all I can remember is troubles with Google Analytics and other third party libraries, which are not enabled in the development mode. As for backend, it is all about logging and monitoring. Also it is better to have a stress tests before you publishing something in production. I am not an expert in tracking down production backend issues.
